Page Load Animation: The main content gracefully fades in and slides up on page load for a smooth entrance.

Dynamic Hover Effects: Interactive elements like cards and buttons exhibit subtle lift, shadow changes, and glowing border effects on hover, enhancing user engagement.

## Customization and Extension

This project is designed to be easily customizable and extensible:

*   **Content Updates:** Modify the text, images, and links within any of the HTML files to update content.
*   **Styling:** Adjust `style.css` to change colors, fonts, spacing, or refine existing animations and effects.
*   **Interactivity:** Extend `script.js` to add new interactive features or modify existing behaviors.
*   **New Pages:** Create additional HTML files for new sections (e.g., "Faculty," "Events Calendar," "Student Life") and update the navigation links accordingly.
*   **Dynamic Data:** For a more robust solution, consider integrating a backend (e.g., Node.js with Express, Firebase, or a headless CMS) to manage announcements, news, events, and research project details dynamically from a database.
